      Transportation & logistics software has zero-tolerance to downtime. Imagine hundreds of passengers 
      <br />
       not being able to book a ticket, drivers not knowing where to pick up/drop off passengers, operators 
      <br />
       seeing empty screens. Disaster!

      GoDeeâ€™s microservice architecture, as well as the quality of the solution itself, make it easy for each Mad 
      <br />
       Devs developer to deploy new features without causing spikes in downtime. On top of that, 
      <span>
        75%
      </span>
       of 
      <br />
       code is covered by various tests and has detailed documentation and pull requests. GoDee's business 
      <br />
       model greatly benefits from economies of scale. Thus, increased demand from Ho Chi Minh citizens is 
      <br />
       backed up by GoDee's unchanging low cost for infrastructure.
