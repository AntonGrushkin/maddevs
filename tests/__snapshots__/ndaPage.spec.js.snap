        All staff members, including contractors and consultants working for Mad Devs, are obliged
        to sign a non-disclosure agreement before getting access to our internal systems. This is
        one of our standard onboarding practices for the employee’s day one. At Mad Devs, we
        understand how important it is to protect our technology and process know-how.

        Even if our customer doesn’t have an NDA in place, we will protect their business secrets
        and any of the competitive advantages we create for them by our non-disclosure agreement.

        Some of our customers have standard NDA templates pre-approved by their legal
        departments. If we are offered to sign such an agreement, we always proceed with it as the
        customer knows their industry better. If a customer offers us some additional instructions or
        training on confidential information in their organization, we eagerly agree. Any requirements
        related to data protection, distribution, processing, or storage under NDA will be taken into
        consideration and applied in the process of work on the customer’s project.

        Many customers prefer to create a tailored NDA for Mad Devs in collaboration with us. This
        practice is also very welcome. We are ready to explain how data will circulate within the new
        system, list the tools that we use, and describe the process our team follows. We are used to
        talking with the customer’s legal department and take efforts aimed at the protection of
        confidential information.
