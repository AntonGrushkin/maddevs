        Our applications send requests to an Nginx server, and then they are processed via the 
        <br />
         gRPC framework and address to separate APIs for each application. APIs refer to Redis 
        <br />
         quick-caching Streams and Georeferencing service, which allows the bus driver to be on

         notification services. We use Docker containers throughout the development process.
