              To make the GoDee app easy to use, we created a system 
              <br />
               that tracks bus location in real time. So every user is able to 
              <br />
               book a seat while their bus is approaching them.

              We use GPS data for bus tracking, and we have developed 
              <br />
               an algorithm for bus travel/arrival time prediction, which 
              <br />
               uses geocoding service and also calculates time 
              <br />
               concerning traffic jams and their severity. The predictor 
              <br />
               functionality calculates estimated arrival time for a bus on 
              <br />
               this or that route. It helps our passengers check if the 
              <br />
               requested bus arrives on time, taking into account 
              <br />
               traffic jams.

              Inside the GoDee application, users can share referrals and 
              <br />
               get free rides as bonuses. After receiving a referral code 
              <br />
               from a referrer, the user can input the code from the 
              <br />
               booking confirmation as a promo code and enjoy one free 
              <br />
               ride. Meanwhile, referrers themselves receive a reward with 
              <br />
               "X" number of free rides.

              As cashless payments are becoming more and more 
              <br />
               popular in Vietnam, we have integrated Stripe service into 
              <br />
               GoDee, enabling the passengers to pay with credit cards 
              <br />
               easily and quickly. We have also developed an API for 
              <br />
               flawless third-party service integration. Visa/Mastercard, 
              <br />
               AmEx, MoMo and JCB are integrated into the GoDee user 
              <br />
               app to facilitate cashless payments. We have also provided 
              <br />
               a personal balance, which can be replenished via the 
              <br />
               above-mentioned payment systems.

              Depending on passengersâ€™ requests, the system allows 
              <br />
               drivers to build the best possible routes automatically. If 
              <br />
               there are no orders from passengers, drivers will skip the 
              <br />
               empty bus and stop along the way.
