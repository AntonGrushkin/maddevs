        To monitor the stability of Namba Food software, Mad Devs has integrated Grafana. It allows our developers
        to keep track of services in Docker containers. Grafana shows how the load in the project is balanced,
        including disk space consumed, memory allocated, swap, load, container uptime, and other parameters.
      </TextParagraph>
      <!-- <Picture/> -->
      <TextParagraph>
        Monitoring also helps Mad Devs to prevent service timeouts. When the load grows, we can track spikes,
        estimate the severity of an issue, and quickly resolve it.

      <TextParagraph>
        A local hosting provider is used for hosting the infrastructure. When a system gets a request from the client,
        it is handled by the Nginx proxy. When the Mad Devs team is deploying a new version, we use the Nginx gen
        server. The Nginx proxy sends requests to the website, which is in its turn connected to the MySQL
        database, and Redis serves as an in-memory key-value storage.
